Doubly linked lists expose:

* head and tail
* nodes that have value attribute alongside next and prev

It is bascially an undirected linear graph

* append: O(1)
* remove_last: O(1)
* prepend: O(1)
* remove_first: O(1)
* get by index: O(n)
* set by index: O(n)
* insert by index: O(n)
* remove by index: O(n)
